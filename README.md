# Health Data Analysis Project

## Overview

The Health Data Analysis Project explores daily steps and energy expenditure to gain insights into the relationship between physical activity and energy burn. The project utilizes a dataset containing information about daily steps, basal energy burned, and active energy burned. The analysis aims to uncover patterns, correlations, and trends within the health data.

## Hypothesis

The hypothesis of this project is that daily energy burn is related to the number of steps taken. The assumption is that if the two parameters are highly dependent, it indicates that physical activity is primarily limited to step count.

## Features

- Daily Steps
- Basal Energy Burned
- Active Energy Burned
- Total Energy (Sum of Basal and Active Energy)
- Interaction Feature (Product of Daily Steps and Total Energy)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (version X.X.X)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/health-data-analysis.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Analysis Steps

1. Load the health data from the CSV file.
2. Filter the data for the year 2023.
3. Extract and analyze daily steps, basal energy, and active energy.
4. Merge and calculate total energy as the sum of basal and active energy.
5. Create an interaction feature by multiplying daily steps and total energy.
6. Perform correlation analysis between steps and energy variables.
7. Train machine learning models to predict steps and energy.
8. Evaluate model performance using metrics such as MSE, RMSE, and R-squared.

## Usage

1. Execute the Jupyter Notebook `health_data_analysis.ipynb`.
2. Follow the steps outlined in the notebook for data analysis and model training.
